# DPS-2

This includes all the scripts for the assignment 2 of DDPS. 

It mainly contains the three parts: 
* The Chord implementation: node.py, client.py, hash.py, range.py, conf.py;
* Experiment 1 - track the path length: e1.py, check_e1.py;
* Experiment 2 - record the number of timeout after node failures occur : e2.py, check_e2.py

Note that the Chord implementation refers to [this repository](https://github.com/kaihuang201/python-chord) and the experiment design refers to [this paper](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/ton:chord/paper-ton.pdf).
